### Summary

I have more than 15 years of experience, of which 8 years in development. During these years I've worn different hats on me: analyst, database architect, team leader and a developer. Also I touched different stacks, but python is my favorite. My main industries are telecom and fintech (namely sw for traders).

I am a perfectionist by nature, but with experience I have learned to limit myself in accordance with the realities of projects. I love and can solve technical problems. I also regularly cultivate myself and spend at least 20 hours a week on it. Together, sometimes it allows me to show results not worse than colleagues who have few times more experience.
