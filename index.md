### Summary

I’ve started my career as a telecom engineer, meanwhile having high
passion to software development. Both of these fields are joined in my
position as a leader of the team, developing software for telco.

I’ve been working in startups having very limited resources, where I've 
had to try myself in different rols.
And I was at something opposite - in huge over-bureaucracy corporations, 
where there are "endless" resources, but you have to collect a thousand of
approvals to get a single pen;)

During setup of development processes I tried a few methodologies. 
My personal pick up is Kanban: it has better balance between the rituals and efficiency.

I can abstract from problem to be able to look on to in from different
angles, which may speed up its solving. As a good side effect of this,
quite frequently, I see both points of view of arguing parties, so I
help them to reach understanding.

With my pet projects I'm touched the following:

  * ML, particularly reinforced learning (tensorforce)
  * bots for crypto-exchanges
  * [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) sw and its customization
  * ELK stack
